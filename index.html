      <h1>Hello we are the Geese and this is our official website!</h1>

      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <p>
        We are a small 3 memeber band coming to you out of the great city of
        Fort Thomas. Our group goes back further than the band. See it all
        started when Joe started to work with Dylan and Thomas in geometry
        class. During the course of the year ocasionally we would get to a
        difficult problem and Thomas would try and brutee force questions in the
        worst way possible. This ended up in the saying "Messa has idea." Which
        is said in a mix of a Jar Jar Binks and Yoda accent.
        <br><br>
        It is non debateable who did most the work that year. Class usually
        ended up with Dylan doing the work. Thomas helping Dylan do the math or
        playing Mario on his calculator. Joe was doing something. The delacate
        balence of doing work was held togeher by Dylan. One day Dylan didn't
        show up and Thomas and Joe managed to goof off the entire class period
        and not do any of the assinged work.
